agent becomes the input of another, or where agents work in parallel on 
related tasks.

# [Team Name]

## Purpose
[2-3 sentences describing what this team accomplishes together]

## Agents

### [Agent Name] — [Role]
- **Bundle:** path/to/agent/CLAUDE.md
- **Role:** lead | support | specialist | reporter | escalation
- **Triggers:** ["list", "of", "trigger", "phrases"]
- **Inputs:** What this agent receives
- **Outputs:** What this agent produces
- **Hands off to:** [Next agent name or "human"]

[Repeat for each agent]

## Handoff Protocol
[How agents pass context between each other]
[What format handoff messages take]
[What triggers a handoff]

## Shared Context
[What all agents share — shared MEMORY.md path, shared data sources]

## Failure Handling
[What happens when an agent fails or times out]
[Which agent or human takes over]

## Success Criteria
[How the team knows it has completed its goal]
```

### Example use cases
- Customer support team (triage → resolve → escalate → follow-up)
- Content pipeline (research → draft → edit → publish → analyze)
- Security audit team (scan → analyze → report → remediate)
- Sales team (qualify → demo → proposal → close → onboard)
